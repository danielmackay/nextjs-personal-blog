## Introduction

As a developer, I'm always looking for ways to optimize my workflow. One of the most tedious, yet critical, tasks I face is creating well-defined Product Backlog Items (PBIs) or user stories. It’s a process that demands careful thought to craft a clear description, acceptance criteria, and relevant notes for the development team. For a long time, this was a completely manual process for me, involving a trip to GitHub.com, navigating to the correct repository, and meticulously filling out issue forms. It was slow, repetitive, and frankly, a bit of a drag. 😫

I knew there had to be a better way. I'd been experimenting with GitHub Copilot and wondered if I could leverage it to streamline this process. This post documents my journey from a fully manual workflow to a sophisticated, conversational system for generating PBIs directly from my editor.

## Solution 1: The Full Manual Slog

Let's set the scene. My initial process was what you might expect:
1.  Open a browser.
2.  Navigate to GitHub.com.
3.  Find the right repository.
4.  Click "Issues" -> "New Issue".
5.  Painstakingly write out the title, description, acceptance criteria, and dev notes from scratch.
6.  Add labels, assignees, and projects.

Every step was manual. It broke my focus and pulled me out of my development environment. The context switch was a killer for productivity.

## Solution 2: My First Prompt and Its Pains

My first step into automation was to create a generic prompt for Copilot Chat. The idea was to generate the *content* of the PBI, which I could then copy and paste into GitHub.

My prompt looked something like this:

```prompt
You are a Scrum Product Owner. Your task is to create a clear and concise PBI with sufficient information for developers to implement it.

The PBI should include the following:

Title: Create a PBI title. The title must start with 🐛 Bug - if it's a bug, or ✨ (just the emoji, no extra words) if it's a feature or change.
Description: Create a PBI description.
Acceptance Criteria: unordered list of the Acceptance Criteria.
Dev Notes: Any important implementation notes for the developer. 
Reproduce Steps: If it's a bug, list the steps to reproduce it. If not, skip this section.

The acceptance criteria should always include:
- Meets [Definition of Done]({DEFINITION_OF_DONE_URL})

Tasks:
{TASKS}
```

While this was a step up from writing everything from scratch, it introduced its own set of problems. The biggest pain point was managing the prompt itself. I had to store it somewhere, find it, copy it, and then paste it into the chat. After generating the text, I still had to go through the whole manual GitHub issue creation dance. It was better, but still clunky and far from seamless.

## Solution 3: Automation with the GitHub MCP Server

This is where things started to get interesting. I discovered the [GitHub MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server), a tool that allows an AI assistant to interact directly with GitHub. This meant I could not only generate the PBI content but also create the issue in one go.

I refined my prompt to include instructions for the MCP server:

```prompt
You are a Scrum Product Owner. Your task is to create a clear and concise PBI with sufficient information for developers to implement it.

The PBI should include the following:

Title: Create a PBI title. The title must start with 🐛 Bug - if it's a bug, or ✨ (just the emoji, no extra words) if it's a feature or change.
Description: Create a PBI description.
Acceptance Criteria: unordered list of the Acceptance Criteria.
Dev Notes: Any important implementation notes for the developer. 
Reproduce Steps: If it's a bug, list the steps to reproduce it. If not, skip this section.

The acceptance criteria should always include:
- Meets [Definition of Done]({DEFINITION_OF_DONE_URL})

Tasks:
{TASKS}

The response should always be in markdown.

Title should be a H2 heading (e.g. ## Title). All other sections should be H3 headings (e.g. ### Description)

create this PBI in {REPO_NAME} repo in {ORG_NAME} organisation.

Add only a GitHub label of "{LABEL}"

Do not include the title in the Github Issue Description

Give me a short summary including the URL of the created PBI when finished
```

This was a significant leap forward. I could now generate a PBI and create the corresponding GitHub issue without leaving VS Code. The manual copy-paste was gone! ✅

## Solution 4: The Power of In-Repo Prompt Files

The main issue with my previous iteration was that my awesome prompt was still a free-floating piece of text I had to manage. The solution? GitHub Copilot's 'prompt files' feature. By storing the prompt in a file within the repository itself (e.g., in `.github/prompts/pbi.md`), I could easily reference it and make it specific to the project.

More importantly, I could make the prompt smarter by having it reference other context-rich files in the repo, like a `definition-of-done.md` or, even better, a `copilot-instructions.md`.

When you use GitHub Copilot locally, it scans your codebase to understand your project. You can supercharge this process by creating a `copilot-instructions.md` file that summarizes all the critical information Copilot needs. You can even ask Copilot to generate a first draft of this file for you! (I've attached the one for this blog as an example).

My prompt now looked like this:

```prompt
You are a Scrum Product Owner. Your task is to create a clear and concise PBI with sufficient information for developers to implement it.

The PBI should include the following:

Title: Create a PBI title. The title must start with 🐛 Bug - if it's a bug, or ✨ (just the emoji, no extra words) if it's a feature or change.
Description: Create a PBI description.
Acceptance Criteria: unordered list of the Acceptance Criteria.
Dev Notes: Any important implementation notes for the developer. 
Reproduce Steps: If it's a bug, list the steps to reproduce it. If not, skip this section.

The acceptance criteria should always include:
- Meets [Definition of Done](./docs/definition-of-done.md)

The response should always be in markdown.

Title should be a H2 heading (e.g. ## Title). All other sections should be H3 headings (e.g. ### Description)

create this PBI in Northwind repo in SSW organisation.

Add only a GitHub label of "Needs Refinement"

Do not include the title in the Github Issue Description

Give me a short summary including the URL of the created PBI when finished

When generating the PBI, reference the [copilot-instructions.md](../copilot-instructions.md) for any additional information you may need about the project.

Ask any questions you need to clarify the requirements before creating the PBI.
```

This was a game-changer. My PBI generation was now context-aware and tailored to the specific project I was working in.

## The "Aha!" Moment: Context + Conversation

The final tweak to my prompt was powerful, but the true "Aha!" moment came when I combined it with the power of VS Code's integrated environment. The prompt now included this line:

> Ask any questions you need to clarify the requirements before creating the PBI.

This was just one part of the puzzle. The real magic happens because I'm running Copilot directly within my project in VS Code. This gives it a massive advantage: it has access to the *entire context* of my codebase. It can read my `copilot-instructions.md`, understand my application's architecture from the code itself, and see how different components interact.

This combination is the ultimate game-changer. Between Copilot now having access to relevant knowledge about the project, and being able to ask questions to fill in gaps in the original requirements, I've found Copilot generating suprisingly high quality PBIs every time. It's not just automation; it's a true, context-aware partnership. 🙌

## Bonus Round: What About Video? 🎥

My journey has been all about perfecting a text-based workflow, which, as a developer, fits me like a glove. But I've worked with enough Product Owners to know that sometimes, talking and showing is way faster than typing. Explaining a tricky UI bug or a complex user flow can be a pain to write out.

If that sounds like you, and you'd rather create PBIs using your voice or a quick screen recording, then you should definitely check out a tool I've been impressed by called [YakShaver](https://yakshaver.ai). It's brilliant for logging bugs because you can just record your screen and talk through the steps. It even helps figure out which repository the issue belongs to, which is a neat trick. For those who live less in the code and more in the product, it could be a real workflow-saver.

## Summary

My quest to optimize PBI creation took me on a journey from tedious manual work to a sophisticated, conversational workflow. By leveraging GitHub Copilot, the MCP Server, and in-repo prompt files, I've eliminated context switching and created a system that's not only faster but also produces higher-quality results. The final step of enabling a clarifying conversation with Copilot was the key that unlocked its full potential, turning it from a simple code generator into a true development assistant.
