# 🧠 DDD Best Practices: Aggregate Root vs Entity

When applying **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, distinguishing between **aggregate roots** and **entities** is key to achieving a well-structured domain model that enforces business rules, maintains invariants, and ensures transactional consistency.

---

## ✅ Best Practices for Choosing an Aggregate Root

### 1. **Enforce Invariants within Aggregate Boundaries**
- An **aggregate** is a **consistency boundary**: all business rules (invariants) must be valid after any change to the aggregate.
- Choose an aggregate root such that it **encapsulates all the entities and value objects** needed to enforce its business invariants.

> 📌 *Example:* In an e-commerce domain, an `Order` AR might enforce the rule that total price must equal the sum of the line items. All `OrderLine` entities are internal to the `Order` aggregate.

---

### 2. **One Transaction per Aggregate**
- Aggregates should be **modified in a single transaction**.
- Avoid designing aggregates that require coordinating changes across multiple roots in one transaction. If that's needed, revisit your boundaries.

---

### 3. **Design for Reference, Not Containment**
- If one entity needs to refer to another, it usually references the **aggregate root** (e.g., by ID), not an inner entity.
- This encourages **decoupling between aggregates**.

---

### 4. **Keep Aggregates Small**
- The smaller the aggregate, the less likely it will lead to performance or concurrency issues.
- Don’t include unrelated data just because it's "part of the same object graph".

---

### 5. **Access Internal Entities Through the Root**
- All operations on an aggregate should go **through the root**, not directly to its internal entities.
- This ensures the root can enforce invariants and control state changes.

---

### 6. **Entity Lifecycle is Tied to the Aggregate**
- If an entity **cannot exist without the root**, it's often a good candidate to be **internal to the aggregate**.
- If it has its own **distinct lifecycle**, it may be its own aggregate.

> 📌 *Example:* In a school domain, a `Classroom` might be an aggregate, but a `Student` can exist independently and be part of many aggregates (like `Classroom`, `Club`, `SportTeam`). `Student` is likely an aggregate root.

## 🧭 Guidelines to Help Decide

| Question | Implication |
|----------|-------------|
| **Does this entity need to be retrieved and updated independently?** | If yes, it's probably an aggregate root. |
| **Does this entity enforce any business rules that span multiple child objects?** | Then it's likely a good candidate for an aggregate root. |
| **Can this entity exist on its own or outside the root?** | If yes, it may be its own aggregate root. |
| **Do other objects reference this entity directly, or just by aggregate ID?** | If they need direct reference, maybe it should be an aggregate. |
| **Would separate roots require consistency across transactions?** | If so, you may have an aggregate boundary issue. |

## 🚫 Common Mistakes

- **Over-modeling**: Making every object an aggregate root leads to unnecessary complexity.
- **Under-modeling**: Treating deeply connected entities as separate aggregates can cause transactional consistency issues.
- **Thinking in terms of the database schema**: DDD models behavior and business rules, not tables and foreign keys.

## 🔁 Real-world Example: `Order` and `Customer`

- `Customer` is an aggregate root. It has its own lifecycle and identity.
- `Order` is also an aggregate root. It should not contain or depend directly on `Customer`’s internals.
- `Order` may reference the `CustomerId`, but not embed the `Customer`.
