## Introduction

.NET Aspire has transformed how we build cloud-native applications in the .NET ecosystem, providing an opinionated, cloud-ready stack for building observable, distributed applications. üöÄ

While Aspire's default deployment story centers around Azure Container Apps, there are compelling scenarios where you might prefer Azure Web Apps - whether for cost predictability, existing infrastructure investments, or operational simplicity.

### Why Choose Web Apps Over Container Apps?

In my experience with enterprise teams, Web Apps offer several advantages:

- **Fixed-tier pricing** that's more predictable for steady workloads
- **Leverage existing App Service Plans** and infrastructure investments  
- **Simplified management** familiar to traditional operations teams
- **Better integration** with existing monitoring and deployment tooling

### Why Choose Azure SQL Database Over Containerized Databases?

While Container Apps can run containerized databases, Azure SQL Database provides significant advantages for production workloads:

- **Managed service benefits** - automatic backups, patching, and high availability without operational overhead
- **Enterprise-grade security** with built-in threat detection, data encryption, and compliance certifications
- **Performance and scaling** options including serverless compute and hyperscale storage
- **Operational excellence** with monitoring, query performance insights, and automatic tuning
- **Cost optimization** through reserved capacity pricing and pause/resume capabilities

For most enterprise scenarios, the operational simplicity and robust feature set of Azure SQL Database outweigh the flexibility of running database containers. ‚ö†Ô∏è

### What We'll Accomplish

This guide walks you through deploying a .NET Aspire application to Azure Web Apps instead of Container Apps:

‚úÖ **Create a sample Aspire application** with Entity Framework and multiple services  
‚úÖ **Modify AZD Bicep templates** to provision Web Apps and Azure SQL Database  
‚úÖ **Configure service-to-service communication** in a Web Apps environment  
‚úÖ **Deploy and validate** the complete solution  

By the end, you'll understand how to adapt Aspire's deployment model to fit your infrastructure requirements. Let's dive in! üéØ

## Prerequisites

To follow along, ensure you have the following set up:

- Azure CLI (AZ) and Azure Developer CLI (AZD)
- Rider / VS2022 / VS Code
- Active Azure subscription

## Creating a .NET Aspire Application

At SSW I'm one of the maintainers of the SSW Clean Archtiecture Template. This template provides a solid foundation for Clean Architecutre, DDD, and Clean Testing. It leverages .NET Aspire to get an enteprise grade API up and running with real data in seconds.

### Creating the solution

```bash
mkdir AspireWebApp
cd AspireWebApp
dotnet new ssw-ca
```

### Examining the Aspire Setup

As you can see from both the code and the dashboard below, the solution is composed of:

- SQL Server & Database
- Migration Service: Handles database migrations and test data seeding
- API: The main API service with Entity Framework

```cs
using AppHost.Commands;
using Projects;

var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var sqlServer = builder
    .AddSqlServer("sql")
    .WithLifetime(ContainerLifetime.Persistent);

var db = sqlServer
    .AddDatabase("clean-architecture")
    .WithDropDatabaseCommand();

var migrationService = builder.AddProject<MigrationService>("migrations")
    .WithReference(db)
    .WaitFor(sqlServer);

builder
    .AddProject<WebApi>("api")
    .WithEndpoint("https", endpoint => endpoint.IsProxied = false)
    .WithReference(db)
    .WaitForCompletion(migrationService);

builder.Build().Run();
```

## Deployment Process

### Step 1: Initialize AZD
```bash
azd init
azd auth login
```

### Step 2: Configure Infrastructure
- Review and customize Bicep templates
- Set required parameters
- Validate resource configurations

### Step 3: Deploy to Azure
```bash
azd provision
azd deploy
```

### Step 4: Post-Deployment Configuration
- Database migrations and seeding
- Application settings verification
- Health check validation

## Comparing Deployment Options

### Container Apps vs. Web Apps
| Feature | Container Apps | Web Apps |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Scaling | Automatic | Manual/Auto |
| Cost | Pay-per-use | Fixed tier pricing |
| Management | Kubernetes-like | Traditional hosting |

### When to Choose Each Option
- Container Apps: Cloud-native, microservices, variable load
- Web Apps: Traditional apps, predictable load, existing infrastructure
