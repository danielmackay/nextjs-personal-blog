# Plan: Update Blog Post Styling Standards and Add Configuration Clarification

## Overview

Based on the code review of the new C# 14 blog post and user decisions, we need to:

1. Update AGENTS.md to standardize figcaption styling (left-aligned, no center styling)
2. Update existing posts to remove center-aligned figcaption styling for consistency
3. Add clarification about OpenCode's automatic detection of csharp-ls

## User Decisions Summary

- **Issue 1 (Duplicate Banner):** Keep duplicate banner - no action needed
- **Issue 2 (Caption Styling):** Standardize on left-aligned (Option C)
- **Issue 3 (Configuration):** Add auto-detection explanation (Option A)
- **Issue 4 (Date):** Keep current date - no action needed

## Context from Exploration

### Current Figcaption Usage Patterns

Analysis of 25 figcaptions across 6 blog posts revealed:

- **60% (15 occurrences)**: Plain/unstyled (left-aligned by default) - **DOMINANT PATTERN**
- **24% (6 occurrences)**: Inline style with `style={{textAlign: 'center'}}` (all in `automating-pbi-creation-with-github-copilot.mdx`)
- **16% (4 occurrences)**: Tailwind className `className="text-center text-sm italic"` (all in `organising-notes-with-para.mdx`)

The plain/unstyled pattern is clearly the established standard, used across 4 of 6 posts. The centered variants are recent outliers.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Update AGENTS.md Documentation

**File:** `AGENTS.md:65-71`

**Current:**

````markdown
- **Images with Captions**: All images (excluding banner images) must use HTML `<figure>` elements with `<figcaption>` for proper figure text:
  ```jsx
  <figure>
    <img src="/static/images/[slug]/image.png" alt="Descriptive alt text" />
    <figcaption>Figure: Descriptive caption text</figcaption>
  </figure>
  ```
````

````

**Action:** Keep as-is (already documents the correct left-aligned pattern without styling attributes)

**Rationale:** The documentation already shows the correct pattern. No changes needed.

### 2. Remove Center-Aligned Styling from Existing Posts

#### 2a. Update `automating-pbi-creation-with-github-copilot.mdx`
**File:** `data/blog/automating-pbi-creation-with-github-copilot.mdx`

**Changes:** Remove `style={{textAlign: 'center'}}` from all 6 figcaption elements

**Lines to update:**
- Line ~40: First figcaption
- Line ~50: Second figcaption
- Line ~60: Third figcaption
- Line ~70: Fourth figcaption
- Line ~80: Fifth figcaption
- Line ~90: Sixth figcaption

**Pattern change:**
```jsx
// Before
<figcaption style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>Figure: Description</figcaption>

// After
<figcaption>Figure: Description</figcaption>
````

#### 2b. Update `organising-notes-with-para.mdx`

**File:** `data/blog/organising-notes-with-para.mdx`

**Changes:** Remove `className="text-center text-sm italic"` from all 4 figcaption elements

**Pattern change:**

```jsx
// Before
<figcaption className="text-center text-sm italic">Figure: Description</figcaption>

// After
<figcaption>Figure: Description</figcaption>
```

**Note:** Keep any inline links within figcaptions intact, just remove the className attribute.

### 3. Add OpenCode Auto-Detection Clarification

**File:** `data/blog/configuring-opencode-for-csharp-14.mdx:66`

**Current:**

```markdown
Once installed, we can now use OpenCode to work with C# 14 without errors—and without the lengthy, token-burning side quests.
```

**Action:** Add explanation after this sentence

**New text to insert after line 66:**

```markdown
OpenCode will automatically detect the globally installed `csharp-ls` language server and use it instead of the built-in C# language server. No additional configuration is required—the tool takes precedence once it's available in your system PATH.
```

**Rationale:** Clarifies the "how it works" question without being overly technical. Makes it clear that no manual configuration is needed.

## Files to Modify

1. `data/blog/automating-pbi-creation-with-github-copilot.mdx` - Remove inline center styles from 6 figcaptions
2. `data/blog/organising-notes-with-para.mdx` - Remove className center styles from 4 figcaptions
3. `data/blog/configuring-opencode-for-csharp-14.mdx` - Add auto-detection explanation after line 66

## Verification Steps

### 1. Visual Verification

```bash
yarn dev
```

Then manually check these pages in browser:

- `/blog/configuring-opencode-for-csharp-14` - Verify new explanation text appears and figcaptions are left-aligned
- `/blog/automating-pbi-creation-with-github-copilot` - Verify figcaptions are left-aligned (not centered)
- `/blog/organising-notes-with-para` - Verify figcaptions are left-aligned (not centered)

### 2. Build Verification

```bash
yarn build
```

Ensure no build errors occur and all pages generate successfully.

### 3. Content Check

Verify that:

- All figcaptions across the three modified posts render without styling attributes
- The new explanation text in the C# 14 post flows naturally
- No markdown syntax errors were introduced

## Notes

- The duplicate banner in `configuring-opencode-for-csharp-14.mdx` is intentional per user request
- The post date (2026-01-18) is correct and requires no changes
- This standardization ensures future posts follow the left-aligned pattern consistently
